        hotel: "The Ritz-Carlton Abu Dhabi, Grand Canal",

        description: "The Ritz-Carlton Abu Dhabi, Grand Canal is a grandiose, glistening example of Middle Eastern opulence. Case in point: the Ritz-Carlton Suite, which clocks in at 1,356 square feet, has a stylish four-poster bed, spacious powder room, full marble bathroom with a soaking tub, a color therapy shower, separate living and dining areas, a kitchen, and two terraces overlooking the Grand Canal. The 21,500-square-foot Bedouin spa, a short ride from the hotel, is a standalone oasis with a private beach, 16 treatment rooms, plunge pools, saunas, and a plethora of luxurious treatments. Families can make use of Ritz Kids, available daily for children ages four to 12. Those keen on visiting the mosque and learning more about the cultural landmark can catch the hotel shuttle, which runs every 30 minutes. ",

        hotel: "The St. Regis Saadiyat Island Resort, Abu Dhabi",

        description: "This St. Regis Resort, a palatial beachfront property, looks like it belongs in Florida or the Caribbean. Yet it's on the pristine white-sand beaches of Saadiyat Island, skirting the Persian Gulf. Everything about the property feels thought-through, from the expanses of terraced manicured grass, to the palm trees lining the walkways. Guest rooms are a blend of the Mediterranean and the Middle East. If you're lucky enough to get one with a balcony, you'll find it's an idyllic perch from which to watch the waves roll in.",

        hotel: "Park Hyatt Saadiyat Island",

        description: "Park Hyatt Abu Dhabi Hotel and Villas is a glorious beachside oasis just minutes from the city's culture precinct. The resort is one of the city's most popular, and it's immediately obvious why. Positioned within an elite cluster of big-name properties on the shores of Saadiyat Beach, Park Hyatt is just as stately outside as it is refined inside. You'll see plenty of European couples and families looking to make the most of the five miles of pristine beach. But the property also has access to the island's 18-hole golf course and offers up some eco-tourism as well: The hawksbill turtles that nest on Saadiyat are another big draw.",

        hotel: "W Abu Dhabi Yas Island",

        description: "The curvaceous exterior of W Abu Dhabi Yas Island, an architectural masterpiece, is the first thing that catches your eye as you approach the hotel. Then, as you drive over the Yas Marina track (where they hold Formula One races) to the entrance, a certain level of excitement kicks in. It's easy to see why this 499-room over-track property attracts thousands of motor sports enthusiasts to the Yas Island precinct every year.",

        hotel: "Shangri-La Hotel, Qaryat al Beri",

        description: "Shangri-La Hotel, Qaryat al Beri is reminiscent of an Arabic royal residence. The entrance sits at the top of an ascending drivewayâ€”an enchanting introduction to a landmark property on Al Maqta Creek, directly opposite the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque. Our Premier Room had its own terrace with views over the canal toward the Grand Mosque. The sizeable rooms are well appointed, and the bathrooms in particular provide an elegant regional sensibility with archways and wooden lattice work.",
